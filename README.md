# Overview of the Project

# Project: Simple Linear Regression on Housing Dataset

# Objectives
Understand the data: Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to clean and visualize the dataset, uncover patterns, and identify key factors that influence housing prices.
Build the model: Use Simple Linear Regression to predict housing prices based on one feature.
Evaluate model performance: Assess the accuracy of the model using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
Visualize results: Present the regression line and residuals to evaluate the model fit and analyze prediction accuracy.

# Steps Involved
Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, Encode categorical variables, Scale/normalize the data.

Exploratory Data Analysis: Analyze feature correlations, Visualize the relationship between features and housing prices.

Model Building: Train a Simple Linear Regression model using one selected feature.

Model Evaluation: Use test data to validate the model, Calculate evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

Visualization: Plot the regression line and actual vs predicted values, Analyze residuals for any patterns or outliers.

# Tools and Libraries Used
Python
Pandas (Data manipulation)
Matplotlib / Seaborn (Data visualization)
Scikit-learn (Model training and evaluation)
